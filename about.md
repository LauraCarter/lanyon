I'm a part-time researcher with [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/), where I cover issues related to sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. I've been at Amnesty since 2011, full-time until 2018. 

I'm also a part-time research student at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/). I've been part of the [Human Rights, Big Data and Technology Project](https://www.hrbdt.ac.uk/) since the start of 2018. My research interests include algorithmic accountability and gender stereotyping in big data technology.

This website is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with the [Poole](https://github.com/poole) theme. I learned how to make it at a session run by [R-Ladies London](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-london/).

## In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

## There are currently two themes built on Poole:
