I'm a part-time researcher with Amnesty International, where I cover issues related to sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. 

I'm also a part-time research student at the University of Essex. I'm part of the Human Rights, Big Data and Technology Project and my research interests include algorithmic accountability and gender stereotyping in big data technology.

This website was built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with the [Poole](https://github.com/poole) theme. I learned how to make it at a session run by R-Ladies London.

## In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

## There are currently two themes built on Poole:

##* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
